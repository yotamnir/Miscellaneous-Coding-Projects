# Miscellaneous-Coding-Projects

New repository meant to share examples of various coding projects.
* First entry: a fully-connected feedforward network built from scratch, implemented based on material covered in the *DeepLearning.AI* [Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.deeplearning.ai/courses/deep-learning-specialization/), and loosely inspired by the `Keras` neural network implementation for the coding architecture.
